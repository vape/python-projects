### Python Projects

My attempt at implementing the projects [over here](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/) with Python 3.

### Numbers

- [Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/vape/python-projects/blob/master/Numbers/01_Pi/pi.py): Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal
places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.
