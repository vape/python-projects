### Python Projects

My attempt at implementing the projects [over here](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/) with Python 3.

### Numbers

- [Find PI to the Nth Digit](https://github.com/vape/python-projects/blob/master/Numbers/01_Pi/pi.py): Enter a number and have the program generate PI up to that many decimal
places. Keep a limit to how far the program will go.

- [Fibonacci Sequence](https://github.com/vape/python-projects/blob/master/Numbers/02_Fibonacci/fibonacci.py): Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number. (I did it a little differently. See README of that solution for specifics.)

- [Prime Factorization](https://github.com/vape/python-projects/blob/master/Numbers/03_PrimeFactorization/prime.py): Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
