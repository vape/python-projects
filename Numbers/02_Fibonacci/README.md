### Fibonacci Sequence

Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

Note: I didn't do this exactly. I just wrote a recursive and an iterative method which calculates
the Nth fibonacci number. I could also generate the whole sequence but that takes a lot of
memory and limits how far you can go in the series. My iterative implementation is only CPU-bound.
