### Unit Converter (temp, currency, volume, mass and more)

Converts various units between one another. The user enters the type of unit
being entered, the type of unit they want to convert to and then the value. The
program will then make the conversion.

Note: I just implemented the basic conversion functionality. I didn't
bother with entering more categories and units because that's just boilerplate stuff.
