### Binary to Decimal and Back Converter

Converter to convert a decimal number to binary or a binary number to its decimal equivalent.

*Note*: For the first iteration, I'm using built-in Python functions to convert
between binary and decimal. For the second iteration, I'll develop a utility
which will convert between numbers in any two bases.
